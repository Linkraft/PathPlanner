# Path Planner

**Path Planner** is an AI-based path planner program that I worked on during my AI for Games class at the University of Florida. All work done was in the PathSearch class files, where the program's AI algorithms were implemented.

## Usage
Open the project in Visual Studio Enterprise 2019 and navigate to the PathPlannerApp's code file. Then select 'Project' -> 'Set as Startup Project' to get the program to build correctly. Ctrl + F5 to start the program!

## Algorithms
There are were a total of four different algorithms that were made as a part of this project. They are (in order of complexity):
- [Breadth-First Search (BFS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search)
- Greedy Breadth-First Search (a.k.a. [Best-First Search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Best-first_search))
- [Uniform Cost Search](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/uniform-cost-search-dijkstra-for-large-graphs/)
- [A* Search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm)

The development of the algorithms was an iterative process, as all algorithms build off of BFS so only minor modifications are necessary for implementing the other algorithms.

## Documentation & More Information
Please refer to the 'Manual - Path Planner' PDF for information regarding the documentation around the API calls used.

This project took around 6-8 hours to complete, and was completed on February 23rd, 2020.

Please note that the original codebase is not mine; it was created by my professor Jeremiah Blanchard for Full Sail University and University of Florida courses.
