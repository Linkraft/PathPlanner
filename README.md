# Path Planner
**Path Planner** is a AI-based path planner program that I worked on during my AI for Games class at the University of Florida. All work done was in the PathSearch class files, where the program's AI algorithms were implemented.

## Usage
Open the project in Visual Studio Enterprise 2019 and navigate to the PathPlannerApp's code file. Then select 'Project' -> 'Set as Startup Project' to get the program to build correctly. Ctrl + F5 to start the program!
